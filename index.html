                In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.[1]
                The set X is called the domain of the function[2] and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.
                The earliest known approach to the notion of function can be traced back to works of Persian mathematicians Al-Biruni[4] and Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi.[5]
                Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity.
                For example, the position of a planet is a function of time.
                Historically, the concept was elaborated with the infinitesimal calculus at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were differentiable (that is, they had a high degree of regularity).
                The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory,
                and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept.
